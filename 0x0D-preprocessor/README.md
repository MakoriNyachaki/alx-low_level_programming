## Requirements

**General**


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

    All your files should end with a new line

    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

    You are not allowed to use global variables

    No more than 5 functions per file

    The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

    You are allowed to use _putchar

    You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

    Don’t forget to push your header file

    All your header files should be include guarded


## Tasks

[0. Object-like Macro](https://github.com/MakoriNyachaki/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h)

Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024

[1. Pi](https://github.com/MakoriNyachaki/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h)

Create a header file that defines a macro named _PI_ as an abbreviation for the token _3.14159265359_.

[2. File name](https://github.com/MakoriNyachaki/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c)

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.


    You are allowed to use the standard library

[3. Function-like macro](https://github.com/MakoriNyachaki/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h)

Write a function-like macro _ABS(x)_ that computes the absolute value of a number _x_.

[4. SUM](https://github.com/MakoriNyachaki/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h)

Write a function-like macro _SUM(x, y)_ that computes the sum of the numbers _x_ and _y_.
